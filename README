DataFlow
========

This project is a spin-off from the OpenData-BR meta-project [1]. OpenData-BR
intends to provide a platform where people can scrape public data from
government and other sources and produce meaningful and useful information,
to help lit a fire under those in charge.

In the pursuit of that goal, eventually we came up with the idea of a data
flow API, in which each step will transform the data as needed to achieve
each information set.

Right now (Feb 13, 2011) it contains only the existing functionalities,
exported from OpenData-BR and refactored to its new namespace.
