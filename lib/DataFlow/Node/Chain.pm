=head1 NAME

DataFlow::Node::Chain - A "super-node" that can link a sequence of nodes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DataFlow::Node;
    use DataFlow::Node::Chain;

    my $chain = DataFlow::Node::Chain->new(
        links => [
            DataFlow::Node->new(
                process_item => sub {
                    shift; return uc(shift);
                }
            ),
            DataFlow::Node->new(
                process_item => sub {
                    shift; return reverse shift ;
                }
            ),
        ],
    );

    my $result = $chain->process( 'abc' );
    # $result == 'CBA'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Moose> based class that provides the idea of a chain of steps in 
a data-flow. 
One might think of it as the actual definition of the data flow, but this is a 
limited, linear, flow, and there is room for a lot of improvements.

A C<DataFlow::Node::Chain> object accepts input like a regular
C<DataFlow::Node>, but it injects that input into the first link of the
chain, and pumps the output of each link into the input of the next one,
similarly to pipes in a shell command line. The output of the last link of the
chain will be used as the output of the entire chain.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 links

This attribute is a C<< ArrayRef[DataFlow::Node] >>, and it holds the
actual "chain" of nodes to process the data.

=head1 METHODS

The interface for C<DataFlow::Node::Chain> is the same of
C<DataFlow::Node>, except for the accessor method for C<links>.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<DataFlow::Node>

L<List::Util>
